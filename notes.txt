n-body integration in c++

struct/class: body

vector of bodies

Forces: Gravity (& Collisions)

Collisions: f = -kx + beta * dx/dt
x is overlap

x, y, z

pick an integrater

length: AU
time: year / pi
mass: mass of the sun
G: 1

Add energy display
add color
bunch of particles with bouncing
dissipation

Results
forgot to set some vars again - got trash

calc overlap / (r1 + r2) ;
lewis wants less than 10%
k value
diff sizes
dissipation


0 when dir flips
measure energy at that points

measure coeff of restitution and max overlap for a k and restitution

particle sizes of
k and drag that work with 1e-7 to 1e-9
coeff of rest ~ .5
percent overlap < 5%
